<div class="en post-container">
  <p>I’m a Network/Systems Engineer (primarily focused on the the network side) living in New Zealand, and loving what I do.</p>

  <p>This blog is meant as both a space where I can share the things I am learning as well as somewhere to work on my technical writing skills.
  I’ll be writing primarily on topics in the field of networking, but also expect to cover anything else that interests me.</p>
